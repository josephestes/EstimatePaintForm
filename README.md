# EstimatePaintForm

This application calculates the cost of paint for a room given its dimensions.

### Program Logic

- Adapt the previous [Estimate Paint Cost](http://github.com/josephestes/EstimatePaintCost) program to run in a Windows Form
- Include a button to reset the input length and width boxes for subsequent calculations and another button to exit the app
- Output the area of the room and the cost to paint it
- Output the cost to paint the ceiling and a total for both the walls and the ceiling
