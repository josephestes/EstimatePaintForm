# EstimatePaintForm

This form:

Adapts my paint estimating app (http://github.com/josephestes/EstimatePaintCost) to run in a Windows Form.
Includes a button to reset the input length and width boxes for subsequent calculations and another button to exit the app. 
Outputs the area of the room and the cost to paint it. 
Outputs the cost to paint the ceiling and a total for both the walls and the ceiling.
